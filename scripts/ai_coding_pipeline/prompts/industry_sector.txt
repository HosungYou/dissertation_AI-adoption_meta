You are an expert in organizational research and industry classification.

Your task is to classify the INDUSTRY SECTOR in which the AI adoption study was conducted.

INDUSTRY SECTOR CATEGORIES:

1. **Education**
   - K-12 schools, universities, colleges, online education platforms
   - Educational technology companies
   - Training and development organizations
   - Examples: University students using AI tutors, teachers adopting AI grading tools

2. **Healthcare**
   - Hospitals, clinics, medical practices
   - Pharmaceutical companies, health insurance
   - Medical device companies
   - Public health organizations
   - Examples: Physicians using clinical decision support AI, nurses using predictive tools

3. **Business/Finance**
   - Financial services, banking, insurance, investment firms
   - Consulting firms, professional services
   - Accounting, auditing firms
   - Examples: Financial analysts using AI forecasting, bankers using fraud detection AI

4. **Manufacturing**
   - Production, assembly, industrial operations
   - Automotive, aerospace, electronics manufacturing
   - Process industries (chemicals, food production)
   - Supply chain and logistics
   - Examples: Factory workers using AI quality control, engineers using predictive maintenance

5. **Technology**
   - Software companies, tech startups
   - IT departments, technology services
   - Telecommunications, electronics
   - Digital platforms, social media companies
   - Examples: Developers using AI coding assistants, IT professionals using automation tools

6. **Government**
   - Public sector organizations
   - Government agencies (local, state, federal)
   - Military, defense organizations
   - Public administration
   - Examples: Government employees using AI for citizen services, policy analysis tools

7. **Mixed/General**
   - Study spans multiple industries
   - General workforce sample across sectors
   - Non-industry-specific (e.g., general consumer sample)
   - Industry not specified or unclear

CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

1. **Look for explicit industry statements**:
   - "Participants were recruited from healthcare organizations"
   - "The sample consisted of manufacturing employees"
   - "Data were collected from a financial services firm"

2. **Infer from participant descriptions**:
   - "Physicians and nurses" → Healthcare
   - "Software developers" → Technology
   - "MBA students" → Education (even if business-focused)
   - "Bank employees" → Business/Finance

3. **Common locations for industry information**:
   - Method → Participants → Sample description
   - Introduction → Study context
   - Discussion → Practical implications section
   - Abstract → Brief context mention

4. **Handle ambiguous cases**:
   - If participants from ONE specific organization → Use that organization's industry
   - If participants from MULTIPLE organizations in SAME sector → Use that sector
   - If participants from MULTIPLE sectors → "Mixed/General"
   - If industry genuinely unclear → "Mixed/General"

5. **Student samples**:
   - Students studying IN an educational setting → Education
   - Even if business students, engineering students, medical students → Education
   - UNLESS: Study of working professionals taking classes part-time → Use their work industry

6. **Consumer/general public samples**:
   - General consumers using AI products → "Mixed/General"
   - Online panel samples → "Mixed/General"
   - Community samples → "Mixed/General"

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC AI EXAMPLES:

**Education**:
- AI grading systems, intelligent tutoring systems, plagiarism detection
- Learning analytics, personalized learning platforms

**Healthcare**:
- Clinical decision support, diagnostic AI, robotic surgery
- Electronic health records with AI, predictive patient monitoring

**Business/Finance**:
- Algorithmic trading, fraud detection, credit scoring
- Customer relationship management AI, chatbots for customer service

**Manufacturing**:
- Predictive maintenance, quality control AI, robotics
- Supply chain optimization, demand forecasting

**Technology**:
- Code generation tools, DevOps automation, testing AI
- Recommendation engines, search algorithms

**Government**:
- Fraud detection in benefits systems, predictive policing
- Citizen service chatbots, policy analysis tools
