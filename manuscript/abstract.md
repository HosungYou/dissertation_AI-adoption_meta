Rethinking AI Adoption in Organizational Contexts: A Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling Approach

## Abstract (250 words)

Despite the rapid diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) across organizational settings, it remains unclear whether traditional technology acceptance frameworks adequately capture the unique psychological dynamics of AI adoption. This study employs meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) to synthesize correlational data from empirical AI adoption studies in organizational contexts published between 2015 and 2025. Drawing on a 12-construct integrative framework that extends TAM/UTAUT with four AI-specific constructs—trust, anxiety, transparency, and perceived autonomy—three competing structural models are tested: a TAM/UTAUT core model, an integrated model incorporating AI-specific paths, and an AI-only model. Two-stage structural equation modeling (TSSEM) is used to pool correlation matrices and estimate path coefficients, supplemented by one-stage MASEM (OSMASEM) for moderator analyses. The study addresses three research questions: (a) whether traditional TAM/UTAUT paths hold in organizational AI contexts, (b) whether AI-specific constructs explain incremental variance in behavioral intention beyond traditional predictors, and (c) whether AI type, cultural orientation, industry sector, and temporal period moderate key structural paths. Bayesian MASEM with informative priors from prior IT meta-analyses and network analysis further contextualize the findings. This study contributes to theory by empirically evaluating the boundary conditions of established acceptance models in the AI era and offers practitioners evidence-based guidance for designing AI adoption interventions tailored to specific organizational and cultural contexts.
